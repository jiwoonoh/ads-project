## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This repository implements a deep-learning pipeline to:
- **Predict patient race** from chest X-rays using a DenseNet-121 backbone.
- **Audit and explain** those predictions via a unified _necessary & sufficient feature_ framework.
- **Compare** our optimized masks against standard Grad-CAM saliency maps.
- **Expose** and quantify model failures on under-represented groups.

> **Key insight:** We establish baseline performance (95% accuracy) on well-represented racial groups and derive sparse masks that isolate minimal pixel subsets, sufficient and necessary to sustain correct race classification.
